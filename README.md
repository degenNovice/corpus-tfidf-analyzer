A Python tool for text analysis using TF-IDF, lemmatization, stopword filtering, and frequency visualization. This repository provides a straightforward approach to understanding text data, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced data scientists.

## üöÄ Features

- **TF-IDF Calculation**: Efficiently computes Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency to evaluate the importance of words in a document relative to a corpus.
- **Lemmatization**: Reduces words to their base or root form, improving the accuracy of text analysis.
- **Stopword Filtering**: Removes common words that add little meaning to the analysis, focusing on the most relevant terms.
- **Frequency Visualization**: Generates visual representations of word frequencies for easier interpretation of results.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To get started with the Corpus TF-IDF Analyzer, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/degenNovice/corpus-tfidf-analyzer.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd corpus-tfidf-analyzer
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   Use pip to install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üìö Usage

After installation, you can start using the tool. Here‚Äôs a simple example:

1. **Import the Analyzer**:
   ```python
   from tfidf_analyzer import TFIDFAnalyzer
   ```

2. **Initialize the Analyzer**:
   ```python
   analyzer = TFIDFAnalyzer()
   ```

3. **Load Your Data**:
   Load your text data into the analyzer:
   ```python
   analyzer.load_data('your_text_file.txt')
   ```

4. **Run Analysis**:
   Execute the analysis to get TF-IDF scores:
   ```python
   results = analyzer.analyze()
   ```

5. **Visualize Results**:
   Use the built-in visualization methods:
   ```python
   analyzer.visualize_frequency()
   ```

## üìà Examples

### Example 1: Basic Text Analysis

```python
# Sample text
text = """
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence.
It focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language.
"""

# Initialize and analyze
analyzer = TFIDFAnalyzer()
analyzer.load_data(text)
results = analyzer.analyze()
analyzer.visualize_frequency()
```

### Example 2: Analyzing a Document Collection

```python
# Load multiple documents
documents = ['doc1.txt', 'doc2.txt', 'doc3.txt']
analyzer.load_data(documents)
results = analyzer.analyze()
analyzer.visualize_frequency()
```
